This is a mod for Ocarina of Time, to be used together with my planner program.

Upon touching a loading zone in Ocarina of Time, a memory address and pointer will be read, which will be printed to the console of Modloader64.

Create the .pak file with the Modloader64 SDK, according to https://modloader64.com/sdk.html

Build with "modloader64 -bd"
